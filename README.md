# CapstoneProject
This repository provides the source code and supporting documentation for my Ryerson University capstone project; for a certificate program in data analytics, big data and predictive analytics.

Dataset
The chosen theme revolves around leveraging a comprehensive dataset, available at https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/4dabb4afab874804ba121536efaaacb4_0/explore, to derive meaningful conclusions. The primary problem in this project is to address and look at the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research questions delve into aspects such as the geographical spread of the virus, the confirmed number of cases and deaths, and the impact of various interventions such as age, gender, and race. These research questions aim to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of the pandemic and help make informed decisions.

Research questions I will answer:
   - How many confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries are there in total?
   - Which regions or provinces have the highest number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries?
   - Is there any correlation between age, gender, and the severity of COVID-19 cases?
   - How does the mortality rate vary across different age groups and genders?
   - what is the highest Exposer type between close contact, travel-related, outbreak, and community?
   - Are there any spatial clusters or hotspots of COVID-19 cases?
   - what are the COVID-19 outcomes of  mortality, for patients based on their demographic information, pre-existing conditions, symptoms, and geographic location?
